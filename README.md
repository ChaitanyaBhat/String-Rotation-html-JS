# String - Rotation

This is illustrated using HTML and JavaScript.

As you can see in the below image, there is a text box, where you can enter a string which can be letters, numbers or combination of letters and numbers. Below the text box you can find two buttons namely 'Rotate Left' and 'Rotate Right'.

'Rotate Left' button rotates the enterd sting anticlockwise each time when it is clicked and the resulting string is displayed below the button. Similary 'Rotate Right' button rotates the input string clockwise once for every click.
